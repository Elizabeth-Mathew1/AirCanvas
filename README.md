### :mortar_board:  About the project

AirCanvas is a simple application that lets u draw in air depending on the colour of your pen.The model has been trained to detect and draw in three colours, orange,
violet and green. So if you want to have some with colours, go ahead and fork the repo. The application uses OpenCV,which is a library of Python bindings designed 
to solve computer vision problems. The application first detects the colour of the pen and then tracks the movement of its tip to draw patterns.
